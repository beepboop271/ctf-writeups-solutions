# CTF Writeups, Payloads, and Solve Scripts

## by someone okay at this stuff i guess

literally just the title, except i kind of write about my thought process and include some more beginner-oriented or teaching-oriented information, with i guess a goal of helping people understand the problem solving behind it, not just the technical work, if you want just the solution you can go elsewhere, not like i'm good enough to solve hard problems

also, i've only done picoctf2019 and redpwnctf2020 so yeah
