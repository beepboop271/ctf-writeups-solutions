save as xlsm and use the xlsm method because xls doesn't work for some reason

open vba project and run the run function

puts "AEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeE" in a4 but overflows on a5

move code into python and print out the first 100 values of three(), they repeat, so just make it non recursive and find the output is "VUAAKQTLGQNFFGBVUBLWKTNW"

from Crypto.Hash import SHA1
print(SHA1.new(data="AEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEeEVUAAKQTLGQNFFGBVUBLWKTNW".encode()).hexdigest())
