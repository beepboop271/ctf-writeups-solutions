at first consider something related to string comparisons, the fact that current_user is set to null at first, but this isn't the solution since the usage of !== and such is pretty solid (i think)

however every object has certain properties like object.constructor

it just so happens that these properties are functions and each function object has a property .name

users.constructor.name is "Object"

so we can log in to the user "constructor" by doing

1
constructor
Object

then to access data, typeof "constructor" === "string", so that is okay, and users.constructor.restricted is undefined (restricted is not a property on constructor), which gets coerced into false, so the full solution is

1
constructor
Object
2
flag
