parser level searching- can't use asdf()

this is an issue, since we need to explicity output to stdout, and im not aware of printing without using print or sys.stdout.write

searching around google for ideas 'calling function without brackets', found
https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/gc8l8x/is_there_a_way_to_call_a_function_without/

realized you can use decorators

solution:

convert = lambda x: flag
@print
@convert
def fun():
    pass
